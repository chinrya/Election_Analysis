# Election_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this assignment was to sharpen up our skill on for loops, reading a csv, and writing a csv as well, among other things. We went through a CSV of election data in order to get an output of who won the election, and some statistics along with it. 

## Results

After our coding, we were able to see there were 369,711 total votes, with Diana DeGette winning, obtaining 73.8% of the votes, or 272,892 votes.

## Summary

This script can be used for any CSV containing election data with just a little modificaiton, such as breaking down the percentages for everyone, not just the winner, to show an even more in-depth analysis on the breakdown of results, and perhaps showing the output of which counties voted for each candidate, in order to get important voting demographics for future candidates to be able to study.
